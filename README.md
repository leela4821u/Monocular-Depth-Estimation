# Monocular-Depth-Estimation

The MDE.xlsx file contains the evaluated results for each model using the inception module and standard module for comparitive analysis.

The full code, including various models etc can be found in the MONOCULAR_DEPTH_ESTIMATION.ipynb file. The Inception module is included within the standard_unit and standard_unit1 functions, which are currently commented out. You can simply uncomment these functions to access them.

You can access the models I trained from this link "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NDZf73FHvqrPzR73yxvmQjVz8pm-v66j?usp=sharing"
